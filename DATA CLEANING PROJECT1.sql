  -- DATA CLEANING PROJECT- cleanig a raw data into useful data as per requirment 

/* BASIC STEPS 
1. Create a database 
2. Import dataset 
3. clean it */
-- 1. create schema db here rename it. 
-- 2. click db->table-> table data import wizard-> locate the raw file and import -> refresh 
-- 3. select * double click on db world layoff to avoid write it whole time(db selection)

-- CLEANING STEPS 
-- 1. Remove Duplicates
-- 2. Standardize the Data ( spellings...)
-- 3. Null Values or Blank values 
-- 4. Removing any/unnecessary  Cloumns

-- copying data from raw table into staging table

-- find unique columnn if there exists and try to find duplicates 
-- USING WINDOW FUNCTIONS

FROM layoffs_staging;
/*now here if rank_num>1 means duplication beacuse ROW_NUMBER()	Assigns 1, 2, 3â€¦ per partition (or over the entire set if no partition),
 here if 1 comes means there is only 1 group which is being assigned 1. oherwise in case of similarity it will be more than 1.
 */
